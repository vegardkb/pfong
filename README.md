To run, clone repository and run using cargo. Default mode is to play vs heuristic agent.

```
cargo run
```

## Prerequisites
Rust and cargo must be installed, see:

https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

For linux and windows, a couple other dependencies are needed, see:

## Roadmap
- [ ] Make app for android/ios. The road may end with this point tbh.
- [ ] Single player: Small campaign versus opponents with different stats, behavior, different soundtracks (?). Introduce some RPG elements by allowing upgrading mass or acceleration.
- [ ] Multiplayer: Ranked games, rankings.
